## This is a space the develompment of analytical tools used by the Development Research Branch of UN DESA's Economic Analysis and Policy Division. 

At DRB we conduct research on frontier and emerging issues, as well as other economic challenges for countries in conflict and countries in special situations.  We produce policy-oriented research papers and host briefings and seminars responsive to the needs of the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and Member States. We produce the Frontier Technology Issues which delves deep into specific aspects of a new technology. We contribute to the publication of the World Social Report (WSR), in collaboration with UN DESAâ€™s Division for Inclusive Social Development and other United Nations agencies, covering selected long-term development issues and policies, particularly those which cross-cut the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals.
